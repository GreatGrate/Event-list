# Event list
An app that lists information about events
​
## Audience
People who are trying to find information about an event
​
## Experience
A user opens the app... they search for an event and when they click on that even they will get information on that event, such as when it happens, it's origin ETC.
​
# Technical
## Models
I will be working with mostly API and Table views. If I have time I will implement CoreData
​
## Views
- I will create a main menu where you can select:
  - official events only
  - created events only
  - all events
- Country view(Because different countries have different/altered events.)
- After clicking on a country you select an event
- After clicking an event it will display information about that event
- A create event button in the menu
​
## Controllers
ViewController
CoreDataHelper
(Possibly more I haven't thought of yet)
​
## Other
No other
