# Event list
An app that lists events and when they will happen.
​
## Audience
People who are trying to find information about an event
​
## Experience
A user opens the app... they search for an event and when they click on that even they will get information on that event, such as when it happens, it's origin ETC.
​
# Technical
## Models
I will be working with mostly API and Stack views. If I have time I will implement CoreData
​
## Views
- I will need to make a starter view that lists Countries(Because different countries have different/altered events.)
- After clicking on a country you select an event
- After clicking an event it will display information about that event

If I have time:
- I will create a main menu where you can select:
  - official events only
  - unofficial events only
  - all events
- A create event button in the menu
​
## Controllers
ViewController

If I have time:
-CoreDataHelper
​
## Other
No other
